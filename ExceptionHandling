Java Exception Handling

This repository explains Exception Handling in Java with detailed examples covering all major concepts — from basic try-catch to custom exceptions.

🧠 Overview

Exception Handling in Java is a powerful mechanism that handles runtime errors, allowing the normal flow of the application to continue without abrupt termination.

🧩 Key Concepts
1. Types of Exceptions
Checked Exceptions → Detected at compile time (e.g., IOException, SQLException)
Unchecked Exceptions → Occur at runtime (e.g., ArithmeticException, NullPointerException)
Errors → Serious problems not meant to be handled by applications (e.g., OutOfMemoryError)

2. Core Keywords
Keyword	Description
try	Code block where exceptions may occur
catch	Handles the exception
finally	Executes always, used for cleanup
throw	Used to manually throw an exception
throws	Declares exceptions in a method signature


3. Examples Included
Basic try-catch block
Multiple catch block
Nested try blocks
throw and throws examples
finally block usage
Custom Exception creation
Try-with-resources (Java 7+)

4. Best Practices
Catch specific exceptions first, general later
Always log or handle exceptions properly
Release resources using finally or try-with-resources
Avoid using exceptions for normal control flow
Use custom exceptions for domain-specific logic
